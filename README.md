# CS 61A

## What is CS 61A?

Here is the introduction on the [course website](https://cs61a.org/articles/about/#overview).

> The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view.
>
> 1. CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.
>
> 2. CS 61B deals with the more advanced engineering aspects of software, such as constructing and analyzing large programs.
>
> 3. CS 61C focuses on machines and how they execute programs.
In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how to use one particular programming language. We consider a series of techniques for managing program complexity, such as functional programming and object-oriented programming.
>
> CS 61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language. Python is a popular language in both industry and academia. It is also particularly well-suited to the task of exploring the topics taught in this course. It is an open-source language developed by a large volunteer community that prides itself on the diversity of its contributors.
>
> Mastery of a particular programming language is a very useful side effect of CS 61A. However, our goal is not to dictate what language you use in your future endeavors. Instead, our hope is that once you have learned the concepts involved in programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days' work. In fact, you will be asked to learn at least two other languages, Scheme and SQL, during the course.

## My Learning Journey

I spent about three weeks finishing all the labs, homework, projects and discussions. It proved to be a fantastic experience. Despite having prior knowledge of Python, I was delighted to encounter entirely new concepts like higher-order functions, trees, and iterators. Moreover, I also gained the ability to quickly master a new programming language since the course exposed us to a minimum of three different languages.  In summary, regardless of your proficiency level, this course never fails to offer valuable insights and learning opportunities.

## About this repository

This repository contains all my solutions for labs, homework and projects, mostly from Fall 2023. You can access all the material including the textbook, lectures and assignments from the [course website](https://cs61a.org/) for free. By the way, if you are a Chinese student, I also recommend you to read the [Chinese version](https://composingprograms.netlify.app/) of the textbook.

Finally, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all the instructors and TAs for their exceptional dedication and contributions to the course.
